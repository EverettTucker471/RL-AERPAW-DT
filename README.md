# RL-AERPAW-DT
Reinforcement Learning Pipeline over AERPAW UAV Digital Twin.

## Goals
- * Construct a pipeline for the simulation of pedestrian data using SUMO
- * Import building data from OpenStreetMaps and use Sionna for ray tracing
- * Create a realistic simulation for simulating UAV communication with ground users in urban settings.
- * Train a reinforcement learning model to control the UAVs to maximize the communication capacity of the UAV network with the Ground Users.

## Current Task
- * Working on a minimial control framework to simulation UAV and pedestrian movement and provide a wrapper for machine learning algorithms. *

## What's Done Already
- * Generating pedestrian data with SUMO and parsing it into a usable format.
- * Importing data from OpenStreetMaps into Sionna
- * Running Sionna ray tracing algorithms to determine communication metrics like path loss between a UAV and a ground user.
